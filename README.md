# 🌾 Rice Type Classification Using Machine Learning

A machine learning and deep learning-based project to classify different types of rice grains either from images or tabular grain features. The project includes both a CNN-based image classifier and traditional ML models using SVM/KNN on tabular data.

## 📌 Project Objective

To accurately classify rice grain types such as Basmati, Brown, Red, Sona, and White based on:
- 📷 Visual image features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- 📊 Statistical grain features using machine learning models

This enables fast, reliable identification for use in:
- Quality control
- Inventory management
- Food authenticity verification
